Fly Me To The Moon ðŸŽµ
Fly me to the Moon
Let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars

In other words
Hold my hand
In other words
Baby, kiss me

Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore

In other words
Please, be true
In other words
I love you

Fill my heart with song
Let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore

In other words
Please, be true
In other words
In other words
I love you  ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¸
